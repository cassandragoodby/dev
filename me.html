			<h1>Hello World</h1>
			<h2>My name is Cassandra Goodby</h2>
		</header>

		<p>I am a TAM major who went to Colorado School of Mines for a year and a half. I love engineering but wanted the ability to be creative and thus founded TAM. I love food, animals, crafting, napping and travel. I have an internship at NIST this year.</p>
		<p>I am interested in web development because it bridges my passion of creativity and technology. My internship at NIST project this semester is to create a kiosk in which I will be implimenting HTML5, css and Javascript. My experience is mainly the web class and some personal playing around with web. I am seriously interested in persuing a career in UX/UI design.</p>
		<p>In this class I want to just continue my knowledge of web design and push myself in concepts for web pages that I normally wouldn't do. I also really want to create a portfolio to use for job hunting.</p>
